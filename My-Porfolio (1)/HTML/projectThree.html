        <h2> This program was made to examplify a random walk. As you can see there are some stars they are sitting still and some shooting stars moving randomly all across the screen. I made this using a class for the stars and a random number generator for the direction of movement. Note that some stars do not move in random directions they move in a linear path and that the reason there is an image was because me and my friend were having fun and implementing images.</h2>
