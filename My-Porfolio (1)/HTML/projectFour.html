        <h2>This program is still a work in progress which I hate saying. I hate saying it because the error shouldn't be that hard to fix, yet it is for me. The error is that when the score gets updated in the top left corner of the screen the new score gets shown on top of the old score. When the old score should get removed and replaced with a new score. This program was a lot of fun to make and to be honest it was fairly... besides my error. It also isn't the real craps game because I don't know how to play. </h2>
